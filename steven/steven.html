The goal of the game is to destroy the enemy team's Nexus, located in their base, while defending your own Nexus from enemy attacks. Each game is played on a map called Summoner's Rift, with two teams of five players each. Players must work together to strategize, communicate, and execute their game plan to achieve victory.
    
    The game offers a vast array of champions to choose from, with over 150 available at the time of writing. Each champion has its own playstyle, abilities, and role in the game, such as tanks, mages, assassins, and marksmen. Players can customize their champions with various skins, runes, and items to enhance their strengths and weaknesses..</p>
